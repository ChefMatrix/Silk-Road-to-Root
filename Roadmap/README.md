Work In Progress

CCNA -> CCNP -> TCM Networking courses

TCM Linux 101 -> "Linux Mastery: Master the Linux Command Line in 11.5 Hours" -> Small Project (WIP)

Active Directory & Group Policy Lab -> Attacking And Defending Active Directory: AD Pentesting 

Majority of my learning will come form Udemy, then TCM security. The price of a certificate is high, but the worth of true knowledge is beyond measure.
