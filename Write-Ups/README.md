# Write-Ups: Bug Bounties & Vulnerability Disclosure

This section contains documented write-ups and reports from my hands-on experience in Bug Bounty Programs (BBPs), Vulnerability Disclosure Programs (VDPs), and practical labs from platforms like Hack The Box, TryHackMe, and Offsec.

Each folder focuses on a specific engagement type, with clearly documented methodologies, findings, and reflections ‚Äî structured to replicate real-world reporting standards used in professional security engagements.

## üìÅ Labs (`/Labs`)

Structured write-ups for hands-on labs from:
- Hack The Box (HTB)
- TryHackMe (THM)
- Offensive Security Labs (Offsec Playground)

**Focus Areas:**
- Exploitation methodology
- Pivoting techniques
- Tool usage breakdowns (Burp Suite, nmap, ffuf, etc.)
- Lessons learned and alternative exploitation paths

---

## üìÅ Bug Bounty Programs (`/BugBounty_Programs`)

Write-ups and personal findings from publicly accessible Bug Bounty Programs on platforms such as HackerOne, Bugcrowd, Synack, and private scopes.

**Includes:**
- End-to-end testing workflow
- Discovery and exploitation steps
- Notes on failed attempts and lessons learned
- Remediation recommendations (when applicable)

---

## üìÅ Vulnerability Disclosure Programs (`/Vulnerability_Disclosure`)

Reports from responsible disclosures submitted directly to organizations or via coordinated VDP channels. All disclosed vulnerabilities were tested legally and ethically, and documented only after explicit approval or public acknowledgment.

**Includes:**
- Write-ups structured similar to formal VDP submissions
- Timeline of disclosure and response
- Fix verification (when possible)
