# ðŸ§ª Labs Write-Ups

This folder contains structured write-ups from hands-on labs completed through platforms such as:

- Hack The Box (HTB)
- TryHackMe (THM)
- Offsec Proving Grounds (Playground)

Each lab is approached with a clear methodology:
- Reconnaissance
- Enumeration
- Exploitation
- Post-Exploitation
- Lessons Learned

Write-ups are documented step-by-step for personal review, replication, and future reference. Tools used range from `nmap`, `Burp Suite`, `Gobuster`, and `ffuf`, to custom scripts and exploits.

> All labs were performed in legal, isolated environments. Write-ups are for educational and professional development only.
